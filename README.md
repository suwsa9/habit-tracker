# Habit tracker application âœ¿

## Set reminders to build habits!!


> ### Good habits are hard to build.
> 
> One must be consistent and work on a habit regularly to build a habit. Tracking a habit over time is a great way to
> keep yourself accountable and consistent. However, there are not many habit trackers available online that are free and easy to use. 
> Some tracker applications like notion requires so much work to keep up with that the habit tracker itself becomes an 
> additional habit to keep track of. I would like to create an application that is quick and easy to use, something that
> is functional but not too difficult to implement into a user's daily lifestyle.
> 
> This habit tracker was created for users to keep track of habits and goals in a simple, methodical manner.
> This application can be used to create and track various habits. 
>

> ### Here are some example habits this application can be used to track:
> - drink 4 litres of water a day
> - do yoga for 20 minutes once a week
> - have breakfast lunch and dinner at appropriate times each day

## Phase 4: Task 3
Looking back at the design structure of this project, there are flaws that I would change given the time.
First of all, I would create separate classes for the GUI to handle different tasks, which would improve readability and make my code easier to navigate.
Second, I would create helper methods to refactor repetitive code to reduce redundancy for repetitive methods especially in the GUI, such as marking habits, creating buttons and labels, changing fonts and colours, etc.
